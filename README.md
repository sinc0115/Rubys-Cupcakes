# Ruby's Cupcakes
Website design for a fictional bakery: Ruby's Cupcakes. 

This is a great place to practice CSS, HTML, and contributing to open source and #Hacktoberfest! Please read through the documentation carefully before contributing. 

## Design
The design system is created to be both flexible... and strict. 

You must: 
* Follow the color palette
* Only use the provided font families

You should feel free to: 
* Add in fun animations or special effects
* Suggest UI improvements through issues

### Prototypes - Here's the Design!
Interactive XD Prototype: https://xd.adobe.com/view/a8dd4f8b-bb8f-4d89-b7a9-9db06f175b0e-fd8e/

In the right-hand-panel you will find a 'code' tab. This will let you inspect different parts of the design to see things like their size, color, font, etc. Sort of like dev tools for design.

### Color Scheme
* Background gradient: linear-gradient(#FBEFFF, #F9E2F4) 
* Light Pink: #FBEFFF 
* Bright Pink: #DA4167 
* Blue: #004E89 
* General font: #002E52
* Placholder font: #A3B4C1

### Fonts

### Assets

* KISS - Keep It Simple, Supporter! Fancy code is fun, but simple code is easy to read and easy to maintain. Always favour simplicity.
